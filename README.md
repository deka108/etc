## About

a repository of tools, configurations and settings for my workspace in a day's life.

As nothing stays forever —memories forgotten over time, laptop change / upgrate / gets stolen (hic) / breaks (hichic), moving on to the next step in life, new tools emerge—, I realized the pressing needs to compile i) my knowledge and experience with problems or tools I have worked with and ii) exploration results and best practice findings in writings and codified manner, which I plan to achieve in the near future with this repo.

By making my experience and findings available, I hope future me or other developers who face similar issues or have the need to use or setup something to solve problems can refer back to these docs and solve problems faster and efficiently.

## Notes

- Since I'm using a Mac, most of the installations, setups and scripts are tuned for MacOS and Unix systems. But other than these, some of the available information is OS-agnostic
- I haven't yet to really-really deep delve into systematically structuring the docs as I currently jotted down everything I know first. Do expect and pray I'll able to transform this into a better systematic docs
- The repo'll never be complete. It'll serve as a memory footprint and get updated continuously as I gain more and more findings and experience

## Updates

- Now include common installations and setups :tada:
